## **Problem 1**

Write a function nearly_equal to test whether two strings are nearly equal. Two strings a and b are nearly equal when a can be generated by a single mutation on b. A mutation is defined as inserting a character, deleting a character, replacing a character, or swapping 2 consecutive characters in a string. For simplicity, consider only letters from a to z. and assume that the string will be lower case.

`>>> nearly_equal('python', 'perl') False`

`>>> nearly_equal('perl', 'pearl') True`

`>>> nearly_equal('python', 'jython') True`

`>>> nearly_equal('man', 'woman') False`

## **Problem 2**

Write a program split.py that splits a large file into multiple smaller files. The program should take a filename and the number of lines as arguments and write multiple small files each containing the specified number of lines (The last one may have smaller number of lines).

`$ python split.py files/100.txt 30`

`writing files/100-part1.txt`

`writing files/100-part2.txt`

`writing files/100-part3.txt` 

`writing files/100-part4.txt`
