# Career @ rorodata

Our mission: Enable data scientists to build any vertical AI application faster, with a very small team

Why is it exciting? It is really hard to productionize machine learning models reliably and at scale. It requires expertise in cloud infrastructure, software engineering and devops. It gets complex to build and manages these systems as workloads scale and use cases change. 

Our objectives: Data scientists rely on us to solve harder engineering problems. We abstract and automate all the complex workflows and give them simple abstractions to go from zero to one, share their work with the world.

If you love building a professional devtools that millions of data scientists will come to rely on to build vertical AI, we would love to have you onboard. We are looking for someone who can help us with devops and backend system design.
