## **Problem: Design and Implement RESTful API for an elevator system**

There is a building with N floors and there are K elevators in that bulding.  All these elevators are controled by a single computer system. The interaction betwen the elevators and the computer system is through a RESTful API.

The user interface for this system is the display and controls available in each lift and each floor. The display in each elevator, pressing any button in the lift etc. will make use of the RESTful API.

Your task is to design and implement the RESTful API. Make reasonable assumptions as required and make sure the API is complete meet all the requirements of the elevator system. Remember that the system should be efficient enough to handle quite tall buildings with many elevators.

Deliverables:

- README explaining the RESTful API
- Implementation of the API in Python/Go
- Deploy the API on Heroku/Digital Ocean/GCP and send us the URL endpoint as well
